## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**category** | **string** | The category type for this error or warning. This field can have one of three values: Application: Indicates an exception or error occurred in the application code or at runtime. Examples include catching an exception in a service&#39;s business logic, system failures, or request errors from a dependency. Business: Used when your service or a dependent service refused to continue processing on the resource because of a business rule violation such as &amp;quot;Seller does not ship items to Antarctica&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Buyer ineligible to purchase an alcoholic item&amp;quot;. Business errors are not syntactical input errors. Request: Used when there is anything wrong with the request, such as authentication, syntactical errors, rate limiting or missing headers, bad HTTP header values, and so on. | [optional]
**domain** | **string** | The name of the primary system where the error occurred. This is relevant for application errors. | [optional]
**error_id** | **int** | A positive integer that uniquely identifies the specific error condition that occurred. Your application can use error codes as identifiers in your customized error-handling algorithms. | [optional]
**input_ref_ids** | **string[]** | An array of reference IDs that identify the specific request elements most closely associated to the error or warning, if any. For JSON, use JSONPath notation. | [optional]

**output_ref_ids** | **string[]** | An array of reference IDs that identify the specific response elements most closely associated to the error or warning, if any. The path format is the same as inputRefId. | [optional]
