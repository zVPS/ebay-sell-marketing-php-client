## `createCampaign()`

```php
createCampaign($body): object
```



This method creates a Promoted Listings ad campaign. A Promoted Listings campaign is the structure into which you place the ads for the listings you want to promote. Identify the items you want to place into a campaign either by &quot;key&quot; or by &quot;rule&quot; as follows: Rules-based campaigns &ndash; A rules-based campaign adds items to the campaign according to the criteria you specify in your call to createCampaign. Key-based campaigns &ndash; Add items to an existing campaign using either listing ID values or Inventory Reference values: Add listingId values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByListingID or bulkCreateAdsByListingId. Add inventoryReference values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByInventoryReference or bulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference. Note: No matter how you add items to a Promoted Listings campaign, each campaign can contain ads for a maximum of 50,000 items. If a rules-based campaign identifies more than 50,000 items, ads are created for only the first 50,000 items identified by the specified criteria, and ads are not created for the remaining items. Creating a campaign To create a basic campaign, supply: The user-defined campaign name The start date (and optionally the end date) of the campaign The eBay marketplace on which the campaign is hosted Details on the campaign funding model The campaign funding model specifies how the Promoted Listings fee is calculated. Currently, the only supported funding model is COST_PER_SALE. For complete information on how the fee is calculated and when it applies, see Promoted Listings fees. If you populate the campaignCriterion object in your createCampaign request, campaign &quot;ads&quot; are created by &quot;rule&quot; for the listings that meet the criteria you specify, and these ads are associated with the newly created campaign. For details on creating Promoted Listings campaigns and how to select the items to be included in your campaigns, see Creating a Promoted Listings campaign. For recommendations on which listings are prime for a Promoted Listings ad campaign and to get guidance on how to set the bidPercentage field, see Using the Recommendation API to help configure campaigns. Tip: See Promoted Listings requirements and restrictions for the details on the marketplaces that support Promoted Listings via the API.

This method resumes a paused campaign, as long as it's end date is in the future. Supply the campaign_id for the campaign you want to restart as a query parameter in the request. Call getCampaigns to retrieve the campaign_id and the campaign status (RUNNING, PAUSED, ENDED, and so on) for all the seller's campaigns.

### Example

$config = Ebay\Sell\Marketing\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new Ebay\Sell\Marketing\Api\CampaignApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$campaign_id = 'campaign_id_example'; // string | A unique eBay-assigned ID for an ad campaign that's generated when a campaign is created. Get a seller's campaign IDs by calling getCampaigns.

try {
    $apiInstance->resumeCampaign($campaign_id);
} catch (Exception $e) {

## `updateCampaignIdentification()`

```php
updateCampaignIdentification($campaign_id, $body)
```



This method replaces the name and the start and end dates of a campaign. Specify the campaign_id you want to update as a URI parameter, and configure the campaignName and startDate in the request payload. If you want to change only the end date of the campaign, specify the current campaign name and set startDate to the current date (you cannot use a start date that is in the past), and set the endDate as desired. Note that if you do not set a new end date in this call, any current endDate value will be set to null. To preserve the currently-set end date, you must specify the value again in your request. Call getCampaigns to retrieve a seller's campaign details, including the campaign ID, campaign name, and the start and end dates of the campaign.
