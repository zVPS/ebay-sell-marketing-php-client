## `getPromotionReports()`

```php
getPromotionReports($marketplace_id, $limit, $offset, $promotion_status, $promotion_type, $q): \Ebay\Sell\Marketing\Model\PromotionsReportPagedCollection

Specify the eBay marketplace for which you want the report run using the marketplace_id query parameter. Supply additional query parameters to control the report as needed.

For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0

Example: &quot;iPhone&quot; or &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; Commas that separate keywords are ignored.
